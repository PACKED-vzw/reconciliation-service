<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>For some possible project ideas please the list below, or see <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/639486/projects/index.html">Possible project ideas</a> (these are intended for 4th year and/or Masters students).</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>The ideas below are designed to give you some idea of the sort of projects that you could do. Feel free to suggest your own topic.</p>

<h3>Data cleaning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you find a dataset that would be useful but is not easy to access? For example, maybe there is a list of animal traits which is in a PDF and you want to convert it to a file for further analysis (maybe even make it available to others to use through, say, <a href="http://figshare.com">figshare</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data mining</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyse the titles of papers describing new parasites, how could you extract information on their host associations?<li>
<li>There are tools to automatically find taxonomic names in text, e.g., <a href="http://gnrd.globalnames.org">http://gnrd.globalnames.org</a> and <a href="http://www.ubio.org/tools/recognize.php">http://www.ubio.org/tools/recognize.php</a>. Test how effective they are by appling them to examples of scientific text. You could use, for example, articles in the journal <a href="http://www.pensoft.net/journals/zookeys/">Zookeys</a> which has names already identified for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visualisation</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of ways to display taxonomic classifications, which do you think is most useful? How could you test this?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are an increasing number of tools to clean lists of taxonomic names, can you evaluate how useful these are?</li>
<li>How fast do taxonomic names change? What are the implications of this for people using these names? For example, for a public museum such as the Hunterian Zoology museum, how many names on the displays have changed since the labels were printed?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mapping</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you test the hypothesis that for a given taxon most of the new species are being found in protected areas?</li>
<li>Can you create some geophylogenies (using, say the tools on this site, or <a href="http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/GenGIS/Main_Page">GenGIS</a>) for a group of taxa? Can you use these tools to test a specific hypothesis of interest?</li>
<li>Can you write a regular expression to extract latitude and longitudes from a scientific paper? Can you use this to build a geographic database?</li>
</ul>
